## 📍 Tookuai Project Installation Guide 😀
* * * 
 ✔ "cd toouukia" on your terminal.
 * * *
 ✔ "npm install" (this would install all dependencies from package.json file).
  * * *
 ✔ "npm run start" (this would start your project and open in it on localhost on your browser on a defualt port 3000).
* * *
 ✔ "npm run api" (this is important as this server has to be running for the app to function well... This command starts the local server).

✌ Cheers You are done!!!
